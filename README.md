## Datasets

- [French rare words lexicon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grimespoint/french-unusual-words): a CSV of 9,351 uncommon French words annotated with gender, lemma, phonological transcription, frequency index, and dictionary definitions for NLP, lexicography, and language‑learning research.
  - Related project: [dailyword](https://github.com/brooks-code/fuzzy-carnival)

- [Toulouse public libraries loans dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grimespoint/toulouse-public-library-mdiathque-dataset): a CSV that contains annual circulation statistics and bibliographic metadata for print, music and movie items from the Toulouse public library collection. It is designed for analyzing lending trends, collection management, patron behavior, and media usage.
  - Related project: [Toulouse biblio chronicle](https://github.com/brooks-code/toulouse-biblio-chronicle)

## Notebooks

- This [EDA guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/grimespoint/toulouse-public-library-loans-dataset-analysis) walks through an analysis of the Toulouse public library loans dataset. It includes basic statistics, outlier detection, and column‑level analytics for fields like title, author, media type, and audience. It also includes summary reports about popular authors, media types and audience trends plus an interactive Jupyter widget for exploratory visualization.

- A hands‑on [exploration of the unusual/rare French words dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/grimespoint/french-rarities-analysis-lexical-data-exploration) presenting a curated set of computational‑linguistics methods for data prep, feature‑level EDA (word form, gender, frequency, definitions), lexical and semantic analyses (affixes, n‑grams), and interactive visualizations. It is intended as a practical toolkit rather than an exhaustive study. The project is designed to be reproducible, extensible and invites to user experimentation and feedback.

## Competitions

- [Kaggle Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/): Playing with some deep learning underused techniques, [ObsCure MNIST](https://github.com/brooks-code/ObsCure_MNIST) ranked 7 (on 1000+ participants) with a 99.94% accuracy.

- [Predicting road accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e10): Had the chance to learn more about residuals, ensembling and blending models. That's what we call a very close competition, ranked 328/4082.
